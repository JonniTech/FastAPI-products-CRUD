# FastAPI Project

This is a basic FastAPI project created as a learning exercise.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building a REST API using FastAPI. It's designed for beginners who are new to FastAPI and want to learn how to create simple web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JonniTech/FastAPI-products-CRUD
    cd FastAPI
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    env\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev main.py
    ```

    This command starts the server with automatic reloading enabled, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected immediately.

2.  Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see the API documentation generated by FastAPI.

## Project Structure

*   `main.py`: Contains the main FastAPI application and API endpoints.
*   `model.py`: Defines the data models used in the API.
*   `database.py`: Handles database connections and operations.
*   `models/table_models.py`: Defines the database table models.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## Dependencies

*   FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs.
*   Uvicorn: An ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server for running FastAPI applications.
*   SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper
*   (Add any other dependencies you are using)
